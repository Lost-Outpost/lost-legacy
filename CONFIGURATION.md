## Optional Content
**As a warning. The optional content has not been tested nearly as heavily as the rest of the list as not everyone has it enabled. Support will be limited if you enable any of the optional content as its more difficult to account for them. If you are at all worried about stability, do NOT enable any.**

When enabling any optional tweaks, the .esp files (if applicable) should already be placed in the correct order in the plugin list for you, but let me know if you notice it at the end of the plugin list so I can fix that.

### Widescreen

I have included the necessary mods to enable widescreen UI support. If you play on a widescreen monitor, this can be enabled in the optional mods section.


### General Rules
When enabling optional content, the plugin should be placed in the correct spot automatically, but verify on the right side of MO2 to be sure it isn't loading at the end of the list. For content with its own section, follow the appropriate readme section for it.

## Mod Configuration

### MCM Menus

All MCM menus have been automated so you are good to ignore them unless you want to change anything.

A few that you may want to tweak:
- Sunhelm - Can tweak Hunger/Thirst/Sleep/Col settings to your liking
- The Ultimate Dodge Mod - Can change the dodge settings and hotkey
- True Directional Movement - Target lock hotkey
- Wildcat combat - Can change the difficulty multipliers and some other combat settings
- Violens - I have killmoves disabled by default, these can be safely enabled/tweaked

## ENB and Presets

> :ledger: You should only ever enable exactly one ENB preset.

Changing ENB is now easier than ever! Simply open Mod Organizer, scroll down to the section labeled "OPTIONAL - ENB", uncheck the default enb "ENB - MAIN PiCho", then check the box for the ENB you wish to use. But only enable one!


## Performance Guide

- (Potato mode isn't in 1.2 yet, read the below steps for now) For very low end devices, change the profile at the top of Mod Organizer to POTATO MODE for maximum performance (and severely reduced visuals) !!Do not do the rest of the steps below if using Potato Mode!!
- 
- Enable the 5 Performance Mode mods in the bottom left of mo2 (Completely changes the grass and tree setup)
- Try switching ENB to the "PERFORMANCE - Cathedralist Fantasy" preset (instructions above) (Drastically changes the look of the list, but very performance friendly)
- Copy the files from `Lost Legacy\profiles\Lost Legacy\Preset - Performance` into `Lost Legacy\profiles\Lost Legacy`
- If you need further performance tweaks, you can try disabling some texture mods like Skyrim 2020, Skyland AIO, Illustrious Whiterun, and Tamrielic Textures
