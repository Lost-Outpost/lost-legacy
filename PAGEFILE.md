# Pagefile Setup

A pagefile is a file on your disk Windows will use when there is not enough RAM available. Never disable the pagefile - this may lead to various issues on your system, such as a Skyrim memory crash.

If you've never touched the pagefile, perform the following steps to prevent from memory crashes:

1. Press Windows + R on your keyboard and enter `sysdm.cpl ,3`
2. Under the Performance section, press 'Settings'

3. Go to the Advanced tab at the top, and at the Virtual memory section press 'Change...'

4. Disable 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'

5. If you have more than one drive, try enabling it for at least one more drive as a backup (make sure it has a decent bit of free space, like 20GB). Set the size to 'Custom size', set the initial and maximum size to at least 20000 (20GB).
