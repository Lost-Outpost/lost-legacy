## Alternate Start and the Main Quest

Lost Legacy uses [Alternate Perspective](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50307). You will spawn in a typical inn room in Helgen. After creating your character, you will need to talk to the dragon statue next to the door to pick your start. Don't forget to choose some starter gear from the several containers in the room. After you chose your start, simply open and walk through the door. You should now be teleported. The "Default" start option means you stay in Helgen and just walk out of the door into the inn.

To begin the Main Quest, you want to head to Helgen's Inn and talk to the Innkeeper. Upon doing so, you will find the normal Innkeeper Dialogue and one extra Option, reading "I'd like to rent a room. (Start Intro (10 gold))", using this option will first seem like a normal bed renting - and is in fact a normal bed renting - however, the next time you sleep in Helgen's Inn, something special is going to happen.

As great as this mod is, it has a tendency to break sometimes due to the nature of the Vanilla Starting scene. Should you have issues with the Dragon attack scene and the beheading, please try the following method to skip the intro:

Go inside the Helgen inn, do NOT talk to the innkeeper, go behind the bar, then down the stairs. Follow that path in the basement until you get to a ladder. Follow the ladder up and go outside. Once outside you should see a dragon head poking out of the hill. Talk to the dragon head and use the Teleport to Keep option to bypass the starting intro and go right to the keep with your faction choice. (Thanks sappydappy!)

## Leveling and Experience

Lost Legacy uses [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) to overhaul Skyrim's outdated leveling mechanics. The main feature of this mod is that your overall character level is no longer affected by your individual skills increasing. Instead, you will gain XP and level up by killing stuff, discovering and clearing locations, reading books, and completing quests. The skills themselves will still level up by simply using them. As of version 1.0.1 this also includes a soft cap on your skills which prevents you from powerleveling too fast. This will likely be removed in a future update for LL.

## Main Gameplay Overhauls and Difficulty

Lost Legacy uses the full suite of [Enairim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191?tab=user+files) mods. All these mods combined make any build you can think of a very viable option. 

For perks we use [Vokriinator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26702). This mod is a combination of Enai's Vokrii and Ordinator, which together create huge perk trees. Any build should be viable and fun to use. Lost Legacy is built as a power fantasy list, buffing the Player as much as possible. If you are looking for a hardcore/requiem/complete difficulty overhaul, this list will probably not satisfy you. 

In Lost Legacy, you have hundreds of spells and buffs available to you thanks to the plethora of magic mods included. Some but not all include:

-[Apocalypse](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1090)
-[Triumvirate](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39170)
-[Arcanum](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65221)
-[Astral Magic 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69938)
-[Forgotten Magic Redone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12711)

[Growl](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31245) and [Sacrosanct](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3928) overhaul Werewolves and Vampires respectively.

[Summermyst](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6285) adds tons of new fun enchantments.
[Thunderchild](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1460) adds and overhauls shouts. You will also now find "pillars" all over the map to further buff certain shouts.

Finally, Lost Legacy uses [Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506) to add a fully fledged out Religion system! You can choose to worship different deities as well as even Daedra. They all provide different up and downsides, please consult the modpage for them as this is a very in depth mod. Religion can be an extremely powerful tool to push your build to the next level. Please note that this list includes [Sneak to follow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33754).

Lost Legacy uses [Wildcat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1368) as it's main Combat Overhaul. [CGO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60258) is included for the jump attacks. [TUDM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63000) provides dodging. [TDM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614) is included to overhaul Skyrim's outdated third person mechanics and to make it a viable playstyle. [Real Bosses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18183) makes bossfights actually feel like bossfights and not just another generic bandit.





  
## Sunhelm/Survival

Lost Legacy includes the Survival/Needs mod called [Sunhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414), which is installed by default but requires activation in-game. With Sunhelm active, you will start to receive penalties if you go too long without eating, sleeping, or spending too long in the cold. To activate it, you can go into the Sunhelm MCM and enable, or simply sleep in a bed and you should receive a prompt with a little roleplay message. The sliders and widget are pre-configured for you, but you can tweak them to your liking (i.e. lower the Needs sliders to require less food/sleep/etc). Note that some settings in the Survival Control Panel also become active when Sunhelm is started.

  
## Misc

### Killmoves

Killmoves are disabled by default. You can enable/tweak them in the Violens MCM.

### Wintersun/Religion

To worship a new deity via their shrine, you must sneak-activate the shrine as simply activating it will just give you the shrine buff.

  
## Quest Mods

### Undeath

Starts automatically at level 30, read [modpage FAQ](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6180) for more details.
