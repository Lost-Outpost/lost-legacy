# Optional Mod Breakdown


## Optional - Combat Mods


### Valhalla Combat

Valhalla Combat implements timed blocking, projectile parrying, stun and execution as well as a non-intrusive stamina management system. This mod is configurable within the in-game MCM, though a default selection is provided. If you enable Valhalla Combat, you must enable “Valhalla Patches” in the optional menu as well. You must also activate “Ordinator - No Timed Block” or “Vokriinator Black – No Timed Blocking” if you are using the optional “Vokriinator Black” perk system. 

### Precision

Precision is a mod that provides Havok collisions for melee. This means that using a combination of hitstop, camera shake, weapon trails and recoil, it creates the feel of realistic physics and collisions for melee attacks. This mod works in first and third person. If enabling Precision you must disable the “Lost_Legacy_Nemesis Output” and enable “Precision - Nemesis Output”. There is also an optional “Precision - Whip Patch - One Third Longer” if you wish to use Whips that is recommended alongside Precision, this optional requires Precision.  


## Optional - Vokriinator Black (EXPERIMENTAL)

### Vokriinator Black

Vokriinator Black increases the number of perks from Vokriinator substantially. This is done by adding perks from Adamant, Path of Sorcery, SPERG, Mysticism, Vokrii and Ordinator into one huge set of trees. This enables a lot of build variety, but comes at the cost of balance. This is very true to the power-fantasy of Lost Legacy, but is to be used at your own risk. If you want to use Vokriinator Black, you must enable every mod in the “OPTIONAL - Vokriinator Black EXPERIMENTAL - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK” section. The one exception is “50 percent More Perk Points”, which is optional but recommended. This perk calculator can be used to plan your builds or just to see all the perks provided in Vokriinator Black.


## Optional - IED (Immersive Equipment Displays)

### Immersive Equipment Displays

Immersive Equipment Displays allows for the display of unequipped gear and custom items on both the player character and NPCs. There is a custom in-game UI (default: Backspace) that allows you to configure the positioning of equipped and unequipped gear in real time. This mod may cause random crashes from time to time, so please be warned. If you wish to enable Immersive Equipment Displays, all mods in the “OPTIONAL - IED” section must be enabled.


## Optional  - Serana Dialogue Addon

### Serana Dialogue Addon

Serana Dialogue Addon is a mod that greatly expands on Serana’s dialogue and features to make her more immersive and interactive. Whilst some of the dialogue may be cringey at times, there is a large expansion of her features and commentary that may benefit all players. If enabling this mod, you must enable all mods in the “OPTIONAL - Serana Dialogue Addon” section. You must start a new character if you want to enable/disable this mod. 


## Optional - For Streamers

### Dice roll of the Gods Minigame

Dice roll of the Gods is a random rolling dice that creates effects in your game. Designed for streamers, with the press of a hotkey (default: ‘numpad slash  /’  ) you can have random changes effected in your game. There is an optional mod available in this section for removing the fear and frenzy options. These mods can be enabled/disabled at any time. This mod can be used independently or together with Wabbajack - A Dice Roll Mod. 

### Wabbajack - A Dice Roll Mod

Wabbajack - A Dice Roll Mod gives the same functionality as the above mod, but with different effects and features, including a cheese wheel explosion, random enemy spawning, and character size/speed adjustments. (Default hotkey: numpad Enter.) This mod can also be enabled/disabled at any time. This mod can be used independently or together with Dice Roll of the Gods.


## Optional - Difficulty

### Enemy (R)evolution of Skyrim - EEOS

Enemy revolution is a mod that allows enemies to use spells, perks, items and shouts which were previously limited to the player only. This means that enemies will use perks from Vokriinator (or Vokriinator Black if that is enabled) as well as spells from spell mods and so on. Due to the power-fantasy nature of Lost Legacy this will scale the difficulty quite quickly, but may also add enemy diversity. This should be enabled/disabled prior to the start of a new save and should not be disabled/enabled mid-playthrough. 

### Genesis Unleashed Levelled

Genesis Unleashed adds enemies to dungeons based on the dungeon type. The mod uses an injection system to add spawns dynamically which may result in enemies being added to already cleared dungeons. There is a configuration book provided in-game. It is advised not to disable/enable this mod mid-playthrough. 

### Know Your Enemy Output

Know your Enemy uses a trait system to change the resistances and weakness of creatures and armors. For example, a Dwarven Machine type enemy will be immune to shock damage and weak to frost. This mod is always enabled, but does nothing unless the output is enabled. Do not disable the mod itself if you do not want to use these features, just the output in the “Optional - Difficulty” section. 

### Lost Legacy Encounter Zones

Lost Legacy uses encounter zones as detailed in the #Lost Legacy Gameplay section. Should you wish to return to normal level scaling in dungeons, you can disable this mod. This mod is enabled by default. Disabling this mod mid-playthrough should be fine, though you may not see its effects until cells reset after some time.

### Realistic AI Detection (RAID)

RAID is a mod that changes and rebalances sneaking and AI detection. It gives enemies enhanced sight and hearing abilities, causes them to search for longer when alerted and attempts to bring a lot more factors into consideration when determining whether enemies detect and/or find you when sneaking. This mod is disabled by default, and should only be enabled/disabled prior to a playthrough. 

### Skyrim Souls RE

Skyrim Souls RE simply unpauses certain game menus like your inventory, magic selection, and favorites menus so the game still goes on around you (though at a slightly slower pace). This mod can be enabled/disabled any time you wish. You can also edit the ini file if you are familiar with the process to choose which menus you wish to pause and which you do not.


## Optional - ENB

### ENB Selection

Lost Legacy ships with a variety of ENB presets for you to choose from. By default, MAIN PiCho is enabled, and is the one GP has customized the most to fit the list. If you wish to change ENB you must disable Main PiCho and select a different ENB. Alternatively you may wish to choose no ENB (POTATO MODE - No ENB). ENBs can be changed at any time, so feel free to boot the game up using each one and see what you prefer! 


## Optional Ultrawide (21x9) or (32x9)

### Ultrawide Configuration

If you play in 21x9 or 32x9 Ultrawide resolution, enable all mods under the relevant section (either “OPTIONAL - Ultrawide 21 by 9 (Beta)” or “OPTIONAL - Ultrawide 32 by 9 (Beta)” depending on your resolution). It should be noted that this functionality is in Beta, and if you are looking for help with troubleshooting any graphical issues you must note your use of these optionals.

### AddItemMenu

AddItemMenu provides a system to browse items by mod, search for specific items and add them to your character without using the console.

This mod is disabled by default and can be enabled/disabled at any time.

This mod is disabled by default and can be enabled/disabled at any time.

### Legacy of the Dragonborn Delay Patch

The Delay Patch for Legacy of the Dragonborn delays the various rewards and quests until higher display counts. Due to the number of displays added in Lost Legacy this allows the museum storylines to progress more slowly. This mod is disabled by default and can be enabled/disabled at any time.

### Nazeem

This Nazeem Mod just changes the way Nazeem walks.. That’s all. This mod is enabled by default and can be enabled/disabled at any time.

### Quickloot RE - No TCC

### Relics of Hyrule - Invisible Fairies
